# mpiPresentation
Presentation of MPI Basics for CIS6930 Summer '19 Semester

mpiExamples/ contains many examples, mostly adapted from the following resources:
  * https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/mpi/
  * https://www.mpich.org/static/docs/v3.1/
  * https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/current/
  * https://mpitutorial.com/tutorials/

To compile examples, just type `make` from that directory. Executables have the same name as the source code file they came from.
